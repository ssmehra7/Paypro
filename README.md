# PayPro: Payment Management System

PayPro is a secure and scalable payment management system designed for smooth transactions, robust authentication, and real-time updates. The project uses Express.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend, with MongoDB as the database.

## Features
- Smooth and atomic transactions using Mongoose transactions.
- Secure authentication and session management with JWT and cookies.
- Protection against CSRF attacks using `SameSite` attributes and HTTP-only cookies.
- Centralized error handling for efficient debugging and error management.
- Real-time transaction updates and a user-friendly interface.
